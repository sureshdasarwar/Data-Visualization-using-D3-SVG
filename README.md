# Data-Visualization-using-D3-SVG

The main objective of this project is to Revisualize the Hans Rosling Gapminder Visualization using d3.js
the visualization is not exact replica of the GapMinder but similar to it which will include all the main 
elements in the visualisation. 

The Visualization contains the following:
1) A bubble	plot representing the countries	of the world. Countries of the world described by GDP and Life
Expectancy mapped	to x and y axis position. The population of each country mapped to bubble area.
2) Appropriate labels and axes.
3) Appropriate use of colour.
4) Country name labels.
5) Ability to view data for	a particular year.
6) Ability to animate the change in country	statistics from year to year (1900-2016).

The data required to recreate the visualisation is given in the Gapminder_All_Time.csv this file contains
fields as below:

1) Country: Country name. 
2) Year: Year for that data observation.
3) Population: The population of the country in this year. 
3) LifeExp: Average	life expectancy in years.
4) GDP: Average	GDP in inflation adjusted dollars.
5) Code: The	country	code.
6) Region: The region	in which the country belongs (similar	to continent).
7) Area: The area	of the country in square kilometres.
8) Coastline:	the	number of kilometres of	coastline	belonging	to the country.
9) Government: Type of Govt. in Country.

Extension of Project:

In the Recreation of GapMinder Visualisation I have created the two Visualisation of Bar charts to show the number
of countries per region and number of countries with govt. type. The bar charts change as the year changes.
