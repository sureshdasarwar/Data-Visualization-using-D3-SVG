elements in the visualisation.

1) A bubble	plot representing the countries	of the world.

1.1) Countries of the world described by GDP and Life Expectancy mapped	to x and y axis position.
1.2) The population of each country mapped to bubble area.

2) Appropriate labels and axes.
3) Appropriate use of colour.
